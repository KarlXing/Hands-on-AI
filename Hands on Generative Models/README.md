# Generative Models

A generative model is a probability distribution $p(x)$ of some samples (e.g., images in MNIST). The idea is that we can generate new samples if we know $p(x)$.

To generate samples, we can learn $p(x)$ explicitly (e.g., VAE, PixelCNN) or implicitly (e.g., GAN). In this section, we're going to get through **VAE** and **GAN** to help people understand how generative models work to generate samples.
