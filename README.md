# Hands-on-AI

This is a repository which aims to give people initial understanding about AI research topics (such as generative models, semantic segmentation, deep reinforcement learning) via easiest code. For each topic, I'm going to introduce its idea briefly  and then go through the code to show people what it can do. I this repository can help people have a basic understanding about these topics. As a result, only vanilla methods will be introduced and advanced variants will not be covered here.


#### Requirements
* pytorch 1.0.0
* numpy 1.16.0
* python 3.6
* jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
